## Study 1 - balanced data

We consider data from a replication by Chandler (2016) of Study 4a of Janiszewski and Uy (2008). Both studies measured the amount of adjustment when presented with vague or precise range of value for objects, with potential encouragement for adjusting more the value.

### Description

@Chandler:2016 described the effect in the replication report:

> Janiszewski and Uy (2008) conceptualized people’s attempt to adjust following presentation of an anchor as movement along a subjective representation scale by a certain number of units. Precise numbers (e.g. $9.99) imply a finer-resolution scale than round numbers (e.g. $10). Consequently, adjustment along a subjectively finer resolution scale will result in less objective adjustment than adjustment by the same number of units along a subjectively coarse resolution scale.

The experiment is a 2 by 2 factorial design (two-way ANOVA) with `anchor` (either round or precise) and `magnitude` (`0` for small, `1` for big adjustment) as experimental factors. A total of 120 students were recruited and randomly assigned to one of the four experimental sub-condition, for a total of 30 observations per subgroup (`anchor`, `magnitude`). The response variable is `majust`, the mean adjustment   for the price estimate of the item. The dataset is available from the **R** package `hecedsm` as `C16`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
# Load packages
library(dplyr)   # data manipulation
library(ggplot2) # graphics
library(emmeans) # contrasts, etc.
library(car) # companion to applied regression
# Example of two-way ANOVA with balanced design
data(C16, package = "hecedsm")
# Check for balance
xtabs(formula = ~ anchor + magnitude,
      data = C16)
```

We can see that there are 30 observations in each group in the replication, as advertised.

### Model fitting


In **R**, the function `aov` fits an analysis of variance model for *balanced data*. Analysis of variance are simple instances of linear regression models, and the main difference between fitting the model
using `aov` and `lm` is the default parametrization used. In more general settings (including continuous covariates), we will use `lm` as a workshorse to fit the model, with an option to set up the contrasts so the output matches our expectations (and needs).

```{r}
# Fit two-way ANOVA model
mod <- aov(madjust ~ anchor * magnitude,
           data = C16)
# Analysis of variance table
summary(mod)
```

The model is fitted as before by specifying the `response ~ explanatories`: the `*` notation is a shortcut to specify `anchor + magnitude + anchor:magnitude`, with the last term separated by a semi-colon `:` denoting an interaction between two variables. Here, the experimental factors `anchor` and `magnitude` are crossed, as it is possible to be in both experimental groups simultaneously.


### Interaction plots

The `interaction.plot` function in base **R** allows one to create an interaction (or profile) plot for a two-way design. More generally, we can simply compute the group means for each combination of the experimental conditions, map the mean response to the $y$-axis of a graph and add the experimental factors to other dimensions ($x$-axis, panel, color, etc.) 

```{r}
C16 |>
 ggplot(mapping = aes(x = anchor,
                      y = madjust,
                      color = magnitude)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1,
              alpha = 0.1) +
  stat_summary(aes(group = magnitude), 
               fun = mean, 
               geom = "line") +
  # Change position of labels
  labs(y = "",
       subtitle = "Mean adjustment") +
  theme_classic() + # change theme
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


In our example, the interaction plot shows a large main effect for `magnitude`, a smaller one for `anchor` and no evidence of interaction --- despite the uncertainty associated with the estimation, the lines are very close to being parallel. Overlaying the jitter observations shows there is quite a bit of spread, but with limited overlap. Despite the graphical evidence hinting that the interaction isn't significant, we will fit the two-way analysis of variance model with the interaction unless we invalidate our statistical inference.

The `emmip` function allows one to return a plot automagically.

```{r}
# Interaction plot
emmeans::emmip(mod, 
               magnitude ~ anchor, 
               CIs = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Estimated marginal means

Because our dataset is balanced, the marginal means (the summary statistics obtained by grouping the data for a single factor) and the marginal effects (obtained by calculating the average cell means by either row or column) will coincide. There are multiple functions that allow one to obtain estimates means for cells, rows or columns, including functionalities, notably `emmeans` from the eponymous package and `model.tables`

```{r}
# Get grand mean, cell means, etc.
model.tables(mod, type = "means")

# Cell means
emmeans(object = mod, 
        specs = c("anchor", "magnitude"),
        type = "response")
# Marginal means
emmeans(object = mod, 
        specs = "anchor", 
        type = "response")
emmeans(object = mod, 
        specs = "anchor", 
        type = "response")
# These match summary statistics
C16 |>
  group_by(magnitude) |>
  summarize(margmean = mean(madjust))
C16 |>
  group_by(anchor) |>
  summarize(margmean = mean(madjust))
```

Since the data are balanced, we can look at the (default) analysis of variance table produced using
`anova` function^[In general, for unbalanced data, one would use `car::Anova` with `type = 2` or `type = 3` effects.]

```{r}
anova(mod)
```

The output confirms our intuition that there is not much different from zero, with a strong effect for magnitude of adjustment and a significant, albeit smaller one, for anchor type.

### Model assumptions

While the conclusions are probably unambiguous due to the large evidence, it would be useful to check the model assumptions. 

The sample size is just enough to forego normality checks, but the quantile-quantile plot can be useful to detect outliers and extremes. Outside of one potential value much lower than it's group mean, there is no cause for concern.

```{r}
car::qqPlot(mod, id = FALSE)
```

With 30 observations per group and no appearance of outlier, we need rather to worry about additivity and possibly heterogeneity arising from the treatment. Independence is plausible based on the context.

The Tukey-Anscombe plot of residuals against fitted values (the group means) indicate no deviation, but the variance appears to be larger for the two groups with a large adjustment. Because the response takes negative values, we can simply proceed with fitting a two-way analysis in which each of the subgroups has mean $\mu_{ij}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{ij}$: in other words, only the data for each subgroup (`anchor`, `magnitude`) are used to estimate the summary statistics of that group. 

```{r}
# Evidence of unequal variance
ggplot(data = data.frame(residuals = resid(mod),
                         fitted = fitted(mod)),
       mapping = aes(x = fitted,
                     y = residuals)) +
   geom_jitter(width = 0.03, height = 0) +
  theme_classic()
# Equality of variance - Brown-Forsythe
car::leveneTest(mod) 
```

Given the Brown-Forsythe test output, we can try fitting a different variance in each group, as there are enough observations for this. The function `gls` in the `nlme` package fits such models; the weight argument being setup with a constant variance (`~1`) per each combination of the crossed factors `anchor * magnitude`.

```{r}
# Fit a variance per group
mod2 <- nlme::gls(
  model = madjust ~ anchor * magnitude,
  data = C16,
  weights = nlme::varIdent(
    form = ~ 1 | anchor * magnitude))

# Different ANOVA - we use type II here
car::Anova(mod2, type = 2)
```

We can see the unequal std. deviation per group when passing the model with unequal variance and unequal means and computing the estimated marginal means. The package `emmeans` automatically adjusts for these changes.

```{r}
emmeans(object = mod2, 
        specs = c("anchor", "magnitude"))
# Compute pairwise difference for anchor
marg_effect <- emmeans(object = mod2, 
        specs = "anchor") |> 
  pairs()
marg_effect
# To get a data frame with data
# broom::tidy(marg_effect)
```


We can then pass the output to `car::Anova` to print the analysis of variance table. The $p$-value for the main effect of `anchor` is `r round(anova(mod)[1,5], 3)` in the equal variance model. With unequal variance, different tests give different values: the $p$-value is `r round(car::Anova(mod2, type = 2)[1,3], 3)` if we use type II effects (the correct choice here), `r round(car::Anova(mod2, type = 3)[2,3], 3)` with type III effects^[The type 3 effects compare the model with interactions and main effects to one that includes the interaction, but removes the main effects. Not of interest in the present context.] and the `emmeans` package returns Welch's test for the pairwise difference with Satterwaite's degree of freedom approximation if we average over `magnitude` to account for the difference in variance, this time with a $p$-value of `r round(broom::tidy(marg_effect)$p.value, 3)`. These differences in output are somewhat notable: with *borderline statistical significance*, they may lead to different conclusions if one blindly dichotomize the results. Clearly stating which test and how the results are obtained is crucial for transparent reporting, as is providing the code and data. Let your readers make their own mind by reporting $p$-values.


### Reporting

Regardless of the model, it should be clearly stated that there is some evidence of heterogeneity. We should also report sample size per group, mention the repartition ($n=30$ per group).

In the present case, we can give information about the main effects and stop here, but giving an indication about the size of the adjustment (by reporting estimated marginal means) is useful. Note that `emmeans` gives a (here spurious) warning about the main effects (row or column average) since there is a potential interaction --- as we all but ruled out the latter, we proceed nevertheless.

```{r}
emm_marg <- emmeans::emmeans(
  object = mod2,
  specs = "anchor"
)
```

There are many different options to get the same results with `emmeans`. The `specs` indicates the list of factors which we want to keep, whereas `by` gives the one we want to have separate analysis for. In formula, we could get the simple effects for `anchor` by level of `magnitude` using `~ anchor | magnitude`, or set `specs = anchor` and `by = magnitude`. We can  pass the result to `pairs` to obtain pairwise differences.

```{r}
# Simple effects for anchor
emm_simple <- emmeans::emmeans(
  object = mod,
  specs = "anchor",
  by = "magnitude"
)
# Compute pairwise differences within each magnitude
pairs(emm_simple)
```

### Multiplicity adjustment

By default, `emmeans` will compute adjustments for pairwise difference using Tukey's honest significant difference method if there are more than one pairwise comparison. The software cannot easily guess the degrees of freedom, the number of tests, etc.

There are also tests which are not of interest: for example, one probably wouldn't want to compute the difference between the adjustment for (small magnitude and round) versus (large magnitude and precise).

If we were interested in looking at all pairwise differences, we could keep all of the cells means.

```{r}
emmeans(object = mod2, 
        specs = c("magnitude", "anchor"), 
        contr = "pairwise")
```

Notice now the mention about Tukey's effect. When there is heterogeneity of variance or unbalanced effects, the actual method employed is called **Games-Howell** correction.


## Study 2 - unbalanced data


We now reproduce the results of Study 1 of @Maglio/Polman:2014. Data were obtained from the Open Science Foundation and are available in the `MP14_S1` dataset in package `hecedsm`.

> We carried out a 2 (orientation: toward, away from) × 4 (station: Spadina, St. George, Bloor-Yonge, Sherbourne) analysis of variance (ANOVA) on closeness ratings.

```{r}
data(MP14_S1, package = "hecedsm")
xtabs(~ direction + station, data = MP14_S1)
```

The counts are not balanced, but not far from being equal in each group.

Based on the actual study, it is quite clear we expect there will be an interaction if there is an actual effect. Lack of interaction would entail that subjective distance is perceived the same way regardless of the direction of travel. 

### Model assumptions

Since the data are unbalanced, we can fit the model using `lm`. The default parametrization of the linear model uses the first alphanumerical value for the factor as reference category and coefficients encode differences relative to this particular average. We can obtain the sum-to-zero by setting the option `contr.sum`^[The second term specifies the default option for continuous variables.]

```{r}
str(MP14_S1) # look at data

# Set up contrasts
options(contrasts = c("contr.sum", "contr.poly"))
model <- lm(distance ~ station*direction, 
            data = MP14_S1)
summary(model) # the coefficients are global mean

# Test only the interaction
car::Anova(model, type = 3) 
```

### Model assumptions

We can use type II or type III tests: here, because the interaction term is significant, we could look at simple effects but these are not of scientific interest. Rather, we compute the cell averages and proceed with our contrast setup.

Because of the discreteness of the data (a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5), there is limited potential for outlyingness. If you look at the normal quantile-quantile plot, you should see a marked staircase pattern due to the ties. Brown--Forsythe's test gives no evidence of unequal variance per group, so we proceed with the model.

### Interaction plot

While we can do plots ourselves, the `emmip` function allows us to return a nice looking profile plot with `ggplot2`.

```{r}
emmeans::emmip(object = model, 
               # trace.factor ~ x.factor
               formula = direction ~ station,
               CIs = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# Interaction plot 
# average of each subgroup, with +/- 1 std. error

MP14_S1 |>
  group_by(direction, station) |>
  summarize(mean = mean(distance),
            se = sigma(model) / sqrt(n()),
            lower = mean - se,
            upper = mean + se) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = station,
                       y = mean, 
                       group = direction,
                       col = direction)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, 
                    ymax = upper),
                width = 0.2) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_colour_grey() +
  labs(title = "subjective distance",
       subtitle = "mean (1 std. error)",
       x = "subway station",
       y = "",
       caption = "stations are ordered from west to east") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```


### Contrasts

If the data lend some support for this claim, we could consider the following follow-up questions:

- symmetry
- whether the average perceived distance for St. George (east) and Bloor--Yonge (west) is the same as vice-versa (both one station away from Bay).
- same, but for Spadina and Sherbourne which are two stations away from Bay.
- if the perceived distance for stations Spadina or Sherbourne, which are two away from Bay, are viewed as being twice as distance as St. George and Bloor--Yonge.

For the experiment to make sense, we should check that travel time or distance is indeed roughly the same between each station. These hypotheses can be expressed in terms of contrasts.

In `emmeans`, we keep both factors in the model and begin by computing the cell means and looking at the order of the factors and ordering of the levels to properly set our contrast vectors.


The hypothesis of symmetry is slightly complicated, as we want to test a model which has the same perceived distance for distance, but comparing stations one apart and two apart in the same direction of travel. This leads to four contrast vectors, but we set up the hypothesis test to look at them simultaneously using an $F$-test. If we impose same mean perceived distance for each station with the symmetry, we would have four average instead of the eight cells: the null distribution for the mean comparison will be a Fisher distribution with $\nu_1=8-4=4$ degrees of freedom.


```{r}
emm <- emmeans(model, 
               specs = c("direction", "station"))
levels(emm)
contrast_list <- list(
 "2 station (opposite)" = c(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1),
 "1 station (opposite)" = c(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0),
 "2 station (travel)" = c(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0),
 "1 station (travel)" = c(0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0)
)
# Hypothesis test (symmetry)
emm |> 
  contrast(method = contrast_list) |> 
  test(joint = TRUE)
```

Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is not much difference and we cannot detect departure from symmetry.

The other hypothesis tests, which look at perceived differences one direction or another, quantify the difference in subjective distance depending on whether the station is in the direction of travel or opposite.

\begin{align*}
\mathscr{H}_{01} &: \mu_{\text{E, SG}} + \mu_{\text{W, BY}} = \mu_{\text{W, SG}} +\mu_{\text{E, BY}} \\
\mathscr{H}_{02} &: \mu_{\text{E, Sp}} +\mu_{\text{W, Sh}} = \mu_{\text{W, Sp}} + \mu_{\text{E, Sh}} \\
\mathscr{H}_{03} &: 2(\mu_{\text{E, SG}} + \mu_{\text{W, BY}}) = \mu_{\text{E, Sp}} + \mu_{\text{W, Sh}} \\
\mathscr{H}_{04} &: 2(\mu_{\text{W, SG}} + \mu_{\text{E, BY}}) = \mu_{\text{W, Sp}} + \mu_{\text{E, Sh}} 
\end{align*}

Hypotheses 3 and 4 could be tested jointly, using the same trick we employed for symmetry to impose the linear restrictions on the parameters. We will consider only the pairwise differences in the sequel.

Since we consider arbitrary contrasts between the means of the eight cells, we can account for multiple testing within the family by using Scheffé's method. In `emmeans`, the `adjust = "scheffe"` argument sets up the contrasts, but the output will be incorrect unless we specify the number of groups (for main effects, $n_a-1$, for all cells, $n_an_b-1$) through `scheffe.rank`.

To account for the other tests, we can also reduce the level to decrease the probability of making a type I error.

```{r}
custom_contrasts <- list(
 "2 station, opposite vs same" = 
   c(1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1),
 "1 station, opposite vs same" = 
   c(0, 0, 1, -1, -1, 1, 0, 0),
 "1 vs 2 station (opposite)" = 
   c(-1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, -1),
 "1 vs 2 station (same)" = 
   c(0, -1, 0, 2, 2, 0, -1, 0)
)
# Set up contrasts with correction
cont_emm <- contrast(
  object = emm, 
  method = custom_contrasts,
  adjust = "scheffe")
# Tests and p-values
cont_emm |>
  test(scheffe.rank = 7)
# Tests with confidence intervals
cont_emm |>
  confint(scheffe.rank = 7,
          level = 0.99)
```

Even with a correction for multiple testing, there is strong difference in perceived distance for one station away (direction of travel vs opposite) and similarly for two stations. There is mild evidence that, in one direction, the perceived distance between stations is not equal. A potential criticism, in addition to the design of the scale, would be about real distance between stations may not be the same.
