#  The microwave popcorn experiment

What is the best brand of microwave popcorn? 

- **Factors**
- brand (two national, one local)
- power: 500W and 600W
- time: 4, 4.5 and 5 minutes
- **Response**: <s>weight</s>, <s>volume</s>, <s>number</s>, percentage of popped kernels.
- Pilot study showed average of 70% overall popped kernels (10% standard dev), timing values reasonable
- Power calculation suggested at least $r=4$ replicates, but researchers proceeded with $r=2$...

# Omitting terms in a factorial design

The more levels and factors, the more parameters to estimate (and replications needed)
- Costly to get enough observations / power
- The assumption of normality becomes more critical when $r=2$!

It may be useful not to consider some interactions if they are known or (strongly) suspected not to be present

- If important interactions are omitted from the model, biased estimates/output!

---

# Guidelines for the interpretation of effects

Start with the most complicated term (top down)

- If the three-way interaction $ABC$ is significative:
    - don't interpret main effects or two-way interactions!
    - comparison is done cell by cell within each level
- If the $ABC$ term isn't significative:
    - can marginalize and interpret lower order terms
    - back to a series of two-way ANOVAs

---



# What contrasts are of interest?

- Can view a three-way ANOVA as a series of one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVAs...

Depending on the goal, could compare for variable $A$
- marginal contrast $\psi_A$ (averaging over $B$ and $C$)
- marginal conditional contrast for particular subgroup: $\psi_A$ within $c_1$
- contrast involving two variables: $\psi_{AB}$
- contrast differences between treatment at $\psi_A \times B$, averaging over $C$.
- etc.

See helper code and chapter 22 of Keppel & Wickens (2004) for a detailed example.

# Effects and contrasts for microwave-popcorn

Following preplanned comparisons

- Which combo (brand, power, time) gives highest popping rate? (pairwise comparisons of all combos)
- Best brand overall (marginal means marginalizing over power and time, assuming no interaction)
- Effect of time and power on percentage of popped kernels 
- pairwise comparison of time $\times$ power
- main effect of power
- main effect of time

---


# Preplanned comparisons using `emmeans`


Let $A$=brand, $B$=power, $C$=time

Compare difference between percentage of popped kernels for 4.5 versus 5 minutes, for brands 1 and 2

$$\mathscr{H}_0: (\mu_{1.2} -\mu_{1.3}) - (\mu_{2.2} - \mu_{2.3}) = 0$$

.small[
```{r plannedcomparisonspopcorn, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(emmeans)
# marginal means
emm_popcorn_AC <- emmeans(model, 
                          specs = c("brand","time"))
contrast_list <- 
  list(
    brand12with4.5vs5min = c(0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, -1, 1,0))
contrast(emm_popcorn_AC,  # marginal mean (no time)
         method = contrast_list) # list of contrasts
```

```{r Scheffebyhand, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# Preplanned comparisons

Compare all three times (4, 4.5 and 5 minutes)

- Careful! Potentially misleading because there is a `brand * time` interaction present.

# Motivational example

From Anandarajan et al. (2002), Canadian Accounting Perspective


> This study questions whether the current or proposed Canadian standard of disclosing a going-concern contingency is viewed as equivalent to the standard adopted in the United States by financial statement users. We examined loan officers’ perceptions across three different formats


---

# Alternative going-concern reporting formats

Bank loan officers were selected as the appropriate financial statement users for this study. 

Experiment was conducted on the user’s interpretation of a
going-concern contingency when it is provided in one of three
disclosure formats:

1. Integrated note (Canadian standard)
2. Stand-alone note (Proposed standard)
3. Stand-alone note plus modified report with explanatory
paragraph (standard adopted in US and other countries)

# Multivariate response

![](img/13/questionnaire.png)


---

# Why use MANOVA?

1. Control experimentwise error
  - do a single test instead of $J$ univariate ANOVAs, thereby reducing the type I error
2. Detect differences in combination that would not be found with univariate tests
3. Increase power (context dependent)

---


# Multivariate model
Postulate the following model:
$$\boldsymbol{Y}_{ij} \sim \mathsf{Normal}_p(\boldsymbol{\mu}_j, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}), \qquad j = 1, \ldots J$$

Each response $\boldsymbol{Y}_{ij}$ is $p$-dimensional.

.small[

We assume multivariate measurements are independent of one another, with

- the same multivariate normal distribution
- same covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ (each measurement can have different variance)
- same mean vector $\boldsymbol{\mu}_j$  within each $j=1, \ldots, J$ experimental groups.

]

The model is fitted using multivariate linear regression.

---
# Model fitting with multivariate response

In **R**, we fit a model binding the different vectors of response in a matrix with $p$ columns

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
data(AVC02, package = "hecedsm")
# Fit the model binding variables with cbind
# on left of tilde (~) symbol

  cbind(prime, debt, profitability) ~ format, 
  data = AVC02)

# Model assumptions

.box-inv-5[The more complex the model, the more assumptions...]


Same as ANOVA, with in addition


- The response follow a multivariate normal distribution 
  - Shapiro–Wilk test, univariate Q-Q plots 
- The covariance matrix is the same for all subjects
  - Box's $M$ test is often used, but highly sensitive to departures from the null (other assumptions impact the test)

.small[

Normality matters more in small samples (but tests will often lead to rejection, notably because of rounded measurements or Likert scales)

]
---
# When to use MANOVA?

In addition, for this model to make sense, you need just enough correlation (Goldilock principle)

 - if correlation is weak, use univariate analyses 
   - (no gain from multivariate approach relative to one-way ANOVAs)
   - less power due to additional covariance parameter estimation
 - if correlation is too strong, redundancy
    - don't use Likert scales that measure a similar dimension (rather, consider PLS or factor analysis)

.box-inv-5[Only combine elements that theoretically or conceptually make sense together.]

---
# Testing equality of mean vectors

The null hypothesis is that the $J$ groups have the same mean

- $\mathscr{H}_0: \boldsymbol{\mu}_1 = \cdots = \boldsymbol{\mu}_J$ against the alternative that at least one vector is different from the rest. 

- The null imposes $(J-1) \times p$ restrictions on the parameters.


The test statistic is Hotelling's $T^2$ (with associated null distribution), but we can compute using an $\mathsf{F}$ distribution.


---
# Choice of test statistic

In higher dimensions, with $J \geq 3$, there are many statistics that can be used to test equality of mean.

The statistics are constructed from within/between sum covariance matrices.

These are

- Roy's largest root (most powerful provided all assumptions hold)
- Wilk's $\Lambda$: most powerful, most commonly used
- **Pillai's trace**: most robust choice for departures from normality or equality of covariance matrices

Most give similar conclusion, and they are all equivalent with $J=2$.

# Results for MANOVA

```

]
---

# MANOVA for repeated measures

We can also use MANOVA for repeated measures to get  away from the hypothesis of equal variance per group or equal correlation.



```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
model <- afex::aov_ez(
  id = "id",           # subject id
  dv = "latency",      # response
  within = "stimulus", # within-subject
  data = hecedsm::AA21,
  fun_aggregate = mean)
model$Anova # for models fitted via 'afex'
```

---
# Output


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
model <- afex::aov_ez(
  id = "id",           # subject id
  dv = "latency",      # response
  within = "stimulus", # within-subject
  data = hecedsm::AA21,
  fun_aggregate = mean)
model$Anova # for models fitted via 'afex'
```


.small[

Less powerful than repeated measures ANOVA because we have to estimate more parameters. Still assumes that the covariance structure is the same for each experimental group.

]

---

# Follow-up analyses

Researchers often conduct *post hoc* univariate tests using univariate ANOVA. In **R**, Holm-Bonferonni's method is applied for marginal tests (you need to correct for multiple testing!)

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# Results for univariate analysis of variance (as follow-up)
summary.aov(modMANOVA)
# Note the "rep.meas" as default name 
# to get means of each variable separately
emmeans::emmeans(modMANOVA, specs = c("format", "rep.meas"))
```

.tiny[

A better option is to proceed with descriptive discriminant analysis, a method that tries to find the linear combinations of the vector means to discriminate between groups. Beyond the scope of the course.
