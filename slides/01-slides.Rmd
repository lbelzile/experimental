.box-inv-6[Content]

- Basics of experimental design
- Statistical inference
- Completely randomized designs
- Analysis of variance
- Blocked designs
- Analysis of covariance
- Intro to mixed models
- Intro to causal inference
- Linear mediation analysis

]

???

We will focus on simple designs as they lead to simple analysis. For more complicated schemes, consult an expert or find a collaborator.

A single introductory course in statistics does not make one an expert. The purpose is more numerical literacy then expert knowledge.

However, the assessment, activities and interdisciplinary skills are targeted for PhD students

We will spend a lot of time on ANOVA (one-way, two-way, multivariate, repeated measures, etc.)

The reproducibility crisis has changed the publishing landscape, so the requirements for publications are more stringent. I intend to cover these in details.

Statistical fallacies are common mistakes that discredit the validity of your work. Learning to recognize them in the wild is crucial (also as reviewer).

R.A. Fisher worked 14 years at Rothamsted from 1919 and developed much of the theory underlying experimental design
See this recollection by Yates on his contribution: https://doi.org/10.2307/2528399 

Fisher was a eugenist and his views are largely decried nowadays.

This illustrates changes to the design (Follow now high-contrast in black). This is an example of A/B testing common in web design.

.box-inv-5.medium[Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR)]



???

RAND: In a large-scale, multiyear experiment, participants who paid for a share of their health care used fewer health services than a comparison group given free care. It concluded that cost sharing reduced "inappropriate or unnecessary" medical care (overutilization), but also reduced "appropriate or needed" medical care.
https://www.rand.org/health-care/projects/hie.html

Tennessee's STAR project: smaller class sizes lead to better outcomes
"Over 7,000 students in 79 schools were randomly assigned into one of 3 interventions: small class (13 to 17 students per teacher), regular class (22 to 25 students per teacher), and regular-with-aide class (22 to 25 students with a full-time teacher's aide). Classroom teachers were also randomly assigned to the classes they would teach. The interventions were initiated as the students entered school in kindergarten and continued through third grade."

Clustering sampling: villages, housing blocks, classrooms. Lower quality  than stratified sampling, but cheaper

# Impact of encouragement on teaching

From Davison (2008), Example 9.2

> In an investigation on the teaching of arithmetic, 45 pupils were divided at random into five groups of nine. Groups A and B were taught in separate classes by the usual method. Groups C, D, and E were taught together for a number of days. On each day C were praised publicly for their work, D were publicly reproved and E were ignored. At the end of the period all pupils took a standard test.

# Absence of systematic error


.medium[

- Achieved via randomization
- Controlling the environment
]

???

If we allocate observations non-randomly (for example timing of a course vs instructor), we cannot necessarily distinguish between effects

 Controlled environment: reduce as much variability (room temperature, experimental apparatus, instructions, etc.)

Important: understand reasons for difference
- do not limit to experimental knowledge about the differences
