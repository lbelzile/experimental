# Efficiency of factorial design

.box-inv-4.sp-after.medium[Cast problem<br>as a series of one-way ANOVA <br> vs simultaneous estimation]


.box-4.medium.sp-before[Factorial designs requires<br> **fewer overall observations**]

.box-4.medium.sp-before[Can study **interactions**]

???

To study each interaction (complexity, story book ending) we would need to make three group for each comparison in rows, and one in each column. So a total of 3 one-way ANOVA each with  2 groups and 2 one-way anova with 3 groups. The two-way ANOVA will lead to 6 groups instead of 12.

# Analysis of variance = regression

An analysis of variance model is simply a **linear regression** with categorical covariate(s).

- Typically, the parametrization is chosen so that parameters reflect differences to the global mean (sum-to-zero parametrization).
- The full model includes interactions between all combinations of factors
   - one average for each subcategory
   - one-way ANOVA!

---

# Formulation of the two-way ANOVA

Two factors: $A$ (complexity) and $B$ (ending) with $n_a=3$ and $n_b=2$ levels, and their interaction.

Write the average response $Y_{ijr}$ of the $r$th measurement in group $(a_i, b_j)$ as
\begin{align*}
\underset{\text{average response}\vphantom{b}}{\mathsf{E}(Y_{ijr})} = \underset{\text{subgroup mean}}{\mu_{ij}}
\end{align*}
where $Y_{ijr}$ are independent observations with a common std. deviation $\sigma$.

- We estimate $\mu_{ij}$ by the sample mean of the subgroup $(i,j)$, say $\widehat{\mu}_{ij}$.
- The fitted values are $\widehat{y}_{ijr} = \widehat{\mu}_{ij}$.

---

# One average for each subgroup

| $a_3$ (`easy`) |  $\mu_{31}$ | $\mu_{32}$ | $\mu_{3.}$ |

# Row, column and overall average

- Mean of $A_i$ (average of row $i$): 
$$\mu_{i.} = \frac{\mu_{i1} + \cdots + \mu_{in_b}}{n_b}$$

- Mean of $B_j$ (average of column $j$):
$$\mu_{.j} = \frac{\mu_{1j} + \cdots + \mu_{n_aj}}{n_a}$$

]
.pull-right[
- Overall average:
$$\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_a} \sum_{j=1}^{n_b} \mu_{ij}}{n_an_b}$$

.small[
- Row, column and overall averages are **equiweighted** combinations of the cell means $\mu_{ij}$.
- Estimates are obtained by replacing $\mu_{ij}$ in formulas by subgroup sample mean.

# Vocabulary of effects


- .color-5[**simple effects**]: difference between levels of one in a fixed combination of others (change in difficulty for happy ending)
- .color-5[**main effects**]: differences relative to average for each condition of a factor (happy vs sad ending)
- .color-5[**interaction effects**]: when simple effects differ depending on levels of another factor

# Main effects

.pull-left[


.color-5[**Main effects**] are comparisons between row or column averages

Obtained by *marginalization*, i.e., averaging over the other dimension.

Main effects are not of interest if there is an interaction.

# Contrasts

We collapse categories to obtain a one-way ANOVA with categories $A$ (complexity) and $B$ (ending).

Q: How would you write the weights for contrasts for testing the 

- main effect of $A$: complicated vs average, or complicated vs easy.
- main effect of $B$: happy vs sad.
- interaction $A$ and $B$: difference between complicated and average, for happy versus sad?

The order of the categories is $(a_1, b1)$, $(a_1, b_2)$, $\ldots$, $(a_3, b_2)$.

# Contrasts

Suppose the order of the coefficients is factor $A$ (complexity, 3 levels, complicated/average/easy) and factor $B$ (ending, 2 levels, happy/sad).

| test | $\mu_{11}$ | $\mu_{12}$ | $\mu_{21}$ | $\mu_{22}$ | $\mu_{31}$ | $\mu_{32}$ |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| main effect $A$ (complicated vs average) |  $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ |  $-1$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| main effect $A$ (complicated vs easy) |    $1$ |  $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $-1$ |  $-1$ |
| main effect $B$ (happy vs sad) |    $1$ |  $-1$ | $1$ |  $-1$ | $1$ | $-1$ |
| interaction $AB$ (comp. vs av, happy vs sad) | $1$ | $-1$ | $-1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$ |
| interaction $AB$ (comp. vs easy, happy vs sad) |  $1$ | $-1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $-1$ | $1$ |

# Global hypothesis tests

<!-- Generally, need to compare multiple effects at once -->
.box-inv-5[
Main effect of factor $A$
]

$\mathscr{H}_0$: $\mu_{1.} = \cdots = \mu_{n_a.}$ vs $\mathscr{H}_a$: at least two marginal means of $A$ are different
.box-inv-5[
Main effect of factor $B$
]

$\mathscr{H}_0$: $\mu_{.1} = \cdots = \mu_{.n_b}$ vs $\mathscr{H}_a$: at least two marginal means of $B$ are different
.box-inv-5[

$\mathscr{H}_0$: $\mu_{ij} = \mu_{i \cdot} + \mu_{\cdot j}$ (sum of main effects) vs $\mathscr{H}_a$: effect is not a combination of row/column effect.

# Comparing nested models

Rather than present the specifics of ANOVA, we consider a general hypothesis testing framework which is more widely applicable.

We compare two competing models

- the alternative or full model $\mathscr{H}_a$
- the simpler null model $\mathscr{H}_0$, which imposes $\nu$ restrictions on the full model

???

The same holds for analysis of deviance for generalized linear models. The latter use likelihood ratio tests (which are equivalent to F-tests for linear models), with a $\chi^2_{\nu}$ null distribution.

---

# Intuition behind $F$-test for ANOVA

The more complex fits better (it is necessarily more flexible), but requires estimation of more parameters.

- Test compares the goodness-of-fit and attempts to determine what is the improvement that would occur by chance, if the null model was correct, given $\nu$ additional parameters.

---

# Testing linear restrictions in linear models

If the alternative model has $p$ parameters for the mean, and we impose $\nu$ linear restrictions under the null hypothesis to the model estimated based on $n$ independent observations, the test statistic is

\begin{align*}
F = \frac{(\mathsf{RSS}_0 - \mathsf{RSS}_a)/\nu}{\mathsf{RSS}_a/(n-p)}
\end{align*}

- The numerator is the difference in residuals sum of squares, denoted $\mathsf{RSS}$, from models fitted under $\mathscr{H}_0$ and $\mathscr{H}_a$, divided by degrees of freedom $\nu$.
- The denominator is an estimator of the variance, obtained under $\mathscr{H}_a$ (termed mean squared error of residuals)
- The benchmark for tests in linear models is Fisher's $\mathsf{F}(\nu, n-p)$.

---

# Analysis of deviance

For other generalized linear models with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, we proceed similarly, but we use the log *likelihood* function, $\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ as goodness-of-fit measure.

- The higher the (log) likelihood, the better the fit.
- Obtain parameter estimates  $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0$ under the null hypothesis and 
 $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_a$ under the alternative by maximum likelihood estimation.
- Consider the likelihood ratio statistic  $$R = 2\{\ell(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_a) - \ell(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_0)\}$$
- Under regularity conditions, we compare $R$ to a chi-square distribution with $\nu$ degrees of freedom, $\chi^2_{\nu}$.

# Analysis of variance table

| term | degrees of freedom | mean square | $F$ | 
|------|--------|------|--------|
| $A$  | $n_a-1$   | $\mathsf{MS}_{A}=\mathsf{SS}_A/(n_a-1)$ | $\mathsf{MS}_{A}/\mathsf{MS}_{\text{res}}$ |
| $B$  | $n_b-1$   | $\mathsf{MS}_{B}=\mathsf{SS}_B/(n_b-1)$ | $\mathsf{MS}_{B}/\mathsf{MS}_{\text{res}}$ |
| $AB$ | $(n_a-1)(n_b-1)$ | $\mathsf{MS}_{AB}=\mathsf{SS}_{AB}/\{(n_a-1)(n_b-1)\}$ | $\mathsf{MS}_{AB}/\mathsf{MS}_{\text{res}}$ |

Read the table backward (starting with the interaction).
- If there is a significant interaction, the main effects are **not** of interest and potentially misleading.

# Intuition behind degrees of freedom
.small[

The model always includes an overall average $\mu$.  There are

- $n_a-1$ free row means since $n_a\mu = \mu_{1.} + \cdots + \mu_{n_a.}$ 
- $n_b-1$ free column means as $n_b\mu = \mu_{.1} + \cdots + \mu_{.n_b}$
- $n_an_b-(n_a-1)-(n_b-1)-1$ interaction terms

| $\qquad B$ `ending`<br> $A$ `complexity` $\qquad$ | $b_1$ (`happy`) | $b_2$ (`sad`)| *row mean* |
|------------|:----------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| $a_1$ (`complicated`) | $\mu_{11}$ | $\mathsf{X}$ | $\mu_{1.}$ |
|  $a_2$ (`average`)  | $\mu_{21}$ | $\mathsf{X}$  | $\mu_{2.}$ |
| $a_3$ (`easy`) |  $\mathsf{X}$  | $\mathsf{X}$  | $\mathsf{X}$ |
|*column mean* | $\mu_{.1}$ | $\mathsf{X}$ | $\mu$ |
 
Terms with $\mathsf{X}$ are fully determined by row/column/total averages

# Example 1

The interaction plot suggested that the two-way interaction wasn't significant. The $F$ test confirms this.

There is a significant main effect of both `purchase` and `debttype`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
broom::tidy(car::Anova(mod1, type = 2)) |>
  kable(col.names = c("term","SS","df","F stat","p-value"),
               digits = c(0,1,0,2,3))
```


---

# Example 2

There is a significant interaction between `station` and `direction`, so follow-up by looking at simple effects or contrasts.

The tests for the main effects are not of interest! Disregard other entries of the ANOVA table

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
broom::tidy(car::Anova(mod2, type = 2)) |>
  kable(col.names = c("term","SS","df","F stat","p-value"),
               digits = c(0,1,0,2,3))
```

---

# Main effects for Example 1

We consider differences between debt type labels. 

Participants are more likely to consider the offer if it is branded as `credit` than loan. The difference is roughly 0.5 (on a Likert scale from 1 to 9).

# Reparametrization for Example 2

Set `stdist` as $-2$, $-1$, $+1$, $+2$ to indicate station distance, with negative signs indicating stations in opposite direction of travel

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
MP14_S1 <- MP14_S1 |>
  dplyr::mutate(stdist = factor(dplyr::case_when(
    station == "Spadina" & direction == "east" ~ "-2",
    station == "Spadina" & direction == "west" ~ "+2",
    station == "St. George" & direction == "east" ~ "-1",
    station == "St. George" & direction == "west" ~ "+1",
    station == "Bloor-Yonge" & direction == "east" ~ "+1",
    station == "Bloor-Yonge" & direction == "west" ~ "-1",
    station == "Sherbourne" & direction == "east" ~ "+2",
    station == "Sherbourne" & direction == "west" ~ "-2"))) |>
  dplyr::mutate(stdist = relevel(stdist, ref = "-2"))

```

The ANOVA table for the reparametrized models shows no evidence against the null of symmetry (interaction).

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
# Set up parametrization to sum-to-zero for categorical factors
options(contrasts = c("contr.sum", "contr.poly"))
mod3 <- lm(distance ~ stdist * direction, data = MP14_S1) 
broom::tidy(car::Anova(mod3, type = 2)) |>
  kable(col.names = c("term","SS","df","F stat","p-value"),
               digits = c(0,1,0,2,3))

# Custom contrasts for Example 2

We are interested in testing the perception of distance, by looking at $\mathscr{H}_0: \mu_{-1} = \mu_{+1}, \mu_{-2} = \mu_{+2}$.

#| eval: false
#| echo: true
mod3 <- lm(distance ~ stdist * direction, data = MP14_S1)

  # order is -2, -1, 1, 2
contrasts <- emm |> contrast(
  list("two dist" = c(-1, 0, 0, 1), 
        "one dist" = c(0, -1, 1, 0)))
contrasts # print pairwise contrasts
test(contrasts, joint = TRUE)
