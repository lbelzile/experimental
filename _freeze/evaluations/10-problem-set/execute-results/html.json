Data `MULTI21_D2` from package `hecedsm` contains the data, including unique participant `id`, `lab`, age group (either 5, 6, 7 or 10 year old), different timing for the recall task (either point-and-name, which is always last, delayed recall with 15 seconds after presenting the last image, or immediate response). You can also download the [SPSS database via this link](/files/data/SPSS/MULTI21_D2.sav).\n\n1. Using @Oehlert:2010 approach\n    a. Identify sources of variation\n    b. Identify whether factors are crossed or nested\n    c. Determine whether factors should be fixed or random\n    d. Figure out which interactions can exist and whether they can be fitted.\n2. Fit a linear mixed model with task timing and age categories, accounting for lab and individual-specific variability. Report the conclusions of the two-way analysis of variance: \n    a. are there difference between recall task?\n    b. is the increase between 5 and 7 years the same as from 7 to 10?\n3. Report estimated marginal means  across age groups (separately for each `timing` if there is an interaction), with standard errors.\n4. Produce an interaction plot for mean memory span to mimic Figure 4 of Elliot.\n5. Report the lab-specific variability  and comment on regional differences, if any.\n6. Compute the correlation of measurements for different individuals in a given lab\n\n<!--\n\nThe `HOSM22_E4` data set can be found in the **R** package `hecedsm`. You can also download the [SPSS database via this link](/files/data/SPSS/HOSM22_E4.sav).\n\nConsider the model of @Hatano:2022 for Experiment 4. The authors fitted a linear mixed model for the intrinsic motivation score, along with a continuous covariate (interim rating time) and the rating type (either predicted pre-experiment, or the true rating post-experiment). The rating time was centered. Using @Oehlert:2010 approach\n\n1. Identify sources of variation\n2. Identify whether factors are crossed or nested\n3. Determine whether factors should be fixed or random\n4. Figure out which interactions can exist and whether they can be fitted.\n\n\nNow, fit the linear mixed model using the following code\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lmerTest)\ndata(HOSM22_E4, package = \"hecedsm\")\nmixmod <- lmer(imscore ~ #TODO add covariates, etc.\n               data = HOSM22_E4)\nsummary(mixmod) # coefficients\nanova(mixmod) # type III analysis of variance table\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n5. Report the results for the interaction test: is the interaction statistically significant at level 5%? If not, compute estimated marginal means for rating type, otherwise return estimated differences at `irtime` of `0` (mean centered value), `-2` and `4`.\n6. Compute the correlation between measurements from the same students.\n\n-->\n",
