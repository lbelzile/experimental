Data `MULTI21_D2` from package `hecedsm` contains the data, including unique participant `id`, `lab`, `age` group (either 5, 6, 7 or 10 year old), different `timing` for the recall task (either point-and-name, which is always last, delayed recall with 15 seconds after presenting the last image, or immediate response). You can also download the [SPSS database via this link](/files/data/SPSS/MULTI21_D2.sav).\n\nWe consider the following sources of variation: `age`, `id`, `lab` and `timing`.\n\nFit a linear mixed model for the number of words correctly recalled (`mcorrect`) as a function of task `timing` and `age` categories, their interaction, while accounting for lab and individual-specific variability.\n\n1. Using @Oehlert:2010 approach\n    a. Identify whether factors are crossed or nested.\n    b. Determine whether factors should be fixed or random.\n    c. Figure out which interactions can exist and whether they can be fitted.\n2. Are there difference between recall task (i.e., `timing`)?\n3. Report estimated marginal means  across age groups (separately for each `timing` if there is an interaction), with standard errors.\n4. Report the lab-specific variability  and comment on regional differences based on the predictions of the random effects.^[In SPSS, add `SOLUTION` to your `RANDOM` specification for the `lab` effect. In **R**, assuming you fit the model with the `lmerTest` or `lme4` package, we can extract the predictions of the lab specific mean differences from a fitted model via `lme4::ranef` function.]\n5. Compute the correlation of measurements for different individuals in a given lab, following [the example 12.4 from the course notes](https://lbelzile.github.io/math80667a/mixed.html#exm-verbalization-memorization)\n\n<!--\n\nThe `HOSM22_E4` data set can be found in the **R** package `hecedsm`. You can also download the [SPSS database via this link](/files/data/SPSS/HOSM22_E4.sav).\n\nConsider the model of @Hatano:2022 for Experiment 4. The authors fitted a linear mixed model for the intrinsic motivation score, along with a continuous covariate (interim rating time) and the rating type (either predicted pre-experiment, or the true rating post-experiment). The rating time was centered. Using @Oehlert:2010 approach\n\n1. Identify sources of variation\n2. Identify whether factors are crossed or nested\n3. Determine whether factors should be fixed or random\n4. Figure out which interactions can exist and whether they can be fitted.\n\n\nNow, fit the linear mixed model using the following code\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lmerTest)\ndata(HOSM22_E4, package = \"hecedsm\")\nmixmod <- lmer(imscore ~ #TODO add covariates, etc.\n               data = HOSM22_E4)\nsummary(mixmod) # coefficients\nanova(mixmod) # type III analysis of variance table\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n5. Report the results for the interaction test: is the interaction statistically significant at level 5%? If not, compute estimated marginal means for rating type, otherwise return estimated differences at `irtime` of `0` (mean centered value), `-2` and `4`.\n6. Compute the correlation between measurements from the same students.\n\n-->\n",
