If you feel a section is redundant and overlaps with the latter, feel free to skim through the rest of the material.\n:::\n\n- {{< fa book >}} Chapter 1 of the [Course notes](https://lbelzile.github.io/math80667a/01-introduction.html)\n- {{< fa book >}} Chapter 2 of [*Introduction to Modern Statistics*](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-design.html)\n\nFeel free to inform me in the weekly check-in of your take on these references.\n\n## Complementary readings\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nComplementary readings are additional sources of information that are not required readings, but may be useful substitutes. Sometimes, they go beyond the scope of what we cover (in more details).\n:::\n\n\n- {{< fa book >}} Chapter 1 (*Preliminaries*) in *Planning of experiments*  [@Cox:1958]. Out of print, but addresses the basic concepts using a variety of examples (mostly from agricultural field trials), and particularly well written.\n- {{< fa book >}} Chapter 1 and Sections 2.1-2.2 in *Design and Analysis of Experiments*  [@Dean:2017]\n\n## Slides\n\nThe slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.\n\n\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-primary\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/01-slides.html\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square\"></i> View all slides in new window</a> <a class=\"btn btn-primary\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/slides/01-slides.pdf\" role=\"button\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-file-pdf\"></i> Download PDF of all slides</a></p>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"shareagain\" style=\"min-width:300px;margin:1em auto;\" data-exeternal=\"1\">\n<iframe src=\"/slides/01-slides.html\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" style=\"border:2px solid currentColor;\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<script>fitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});</script>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of slide-specific commands.\n:::\n\n## Case study\n\nWe will discuss the summary of @Mask:2022 [\"The Impact of Mask Distribution and Promotion on Mask Uptake and COVID-19 in Bangladesh\"](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/impact-mask-distribution-and-promotion-mask-uptake-and-covid-19-bangladesh) ([pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20221126024634/https://www.poverty-action.org/printpdf/47486)) in class.\n\nDuring the activity, you will be asked to identify in teams the following:\n\n- the objective of the study\n- the target population (which findings generalize?)\n- the sampling scheme\n- the observational and experimental units\n- the treatments\n- the outcome variable(s)\n\n",
